                        I began my programming career by learning Python on an old PC at home when I was 12 years old.
                        Today, I focus on programming with C# and Unity, implementing core features such as AI systems,
                        game logic, and more into the games I publish. As I continue to pursue my career into the games
                        industry, I remain dedicated to design engaging and fun gameplay experiences. </p>

                        skill and strategy, this offers a fresh take on the traditional Blackjack experience. Players

                        cheat to attempt to get a perfect '21'. However, if they get caught, they face the consequence

                    <h6>Final Year Project Report:</h6>
                    <p>A final year project report was written, documenting the development
                        process, features implemented, and the research conducted while creating the game. This can be
                        viewed <a href="img/Ace_Up/Final Year Report (Submission).pdf">here</a>.<br><br></p>
                    <h6>Develop:Brighton:</h6>
                    <p>AceUp was showcased at Develop:Brighton, where I presented the game in collaboration with the
                        University of Sussex alongside other indie and larger studios. During the showcase, I gathered
                        feedback from playtesters who helped identify bugs and glitches, this feedback aided in the game
                        being published in early December of 2024.</p>

                    <h6>Blackjack Logic:</h6>
                    <p>The Blackjack logic in AceUP was developed using object-oriented programming to create a deck and
                        card management system. A card management script handled shuffling, drawing, and resetting the
                        deck for each round, while a player hand script calculated each player's hand value according to
                        Blackjack rules, including Ace values and the ability to swap cards when cheating. Players could
                        manipulate their hands, which required real-time cheat detection through custom scripts that
                        flagged suspicious actions. If cheating was detected, the game seamlessly transitioned to an
                        FPS-style combat sequence, where throwing cards served as ammunition.</p>

                    <h6>Enemy Pathfinding</h6>
                    <p>Enemy pathfinding was implemented using Unity’s NavMesh system, allowing AI-controlled enemies to
                        navigate the environment effectively. By baking a NavMesh into the scene, enemies could select
                        random positions based on their proximity to other AIs and the playable character. The
                        pathfinding script, 'fightAI', determined whether an enemy should move towards the playable
                        character, the closest player, or a random location, adapting to the gameplay.</p>

                        must find his way back to his parents. In this cozy narrative adventure, you interact with
                        various residents in this small world, each offering unique dialogues and assistance. To help
                        Remi navigate the area and find his parents, you must leave breadcrumbs along the way, creating
                        a path to follow as you explore the island and uncover the stories within.</p>

                    <p>The game features 13 unique NPCs that players can interact with, each contributing to the story
                        and world-building. The dialogue system was implemented early in development, as it was a core
                        mechanic that drives the narrative forward. This system allowed players to engage with
                        characters, uncover new information, and receive breadcrumbs to help Remi continue leaving a
                        trail.</p>

                    <h6>Leave Something Behind:</h6>
                    <p>Breadcrumbs were used to fit the theme of the game jam: 'Leave Something Behind'. Using Unity's
                        Collider component and the OnTriggerExit() function, I was able to detect when and where
                        breadcrumbs should be left behind. The use of breadcrumbs incentivizes players to communicate
                        with the resident NPCs, as each one offers a varying amount to aid in the player's journey.</p>

                        Version Control) to manage tasks, track milestones, and allow for smooth collaboration.</p>

                    <h6>Testing Environment:</h6>
                    <p>During the development process, as 3D assets were being created by my team members and before any
                        levels were made, I created a testing scene where I could begin implementing features from the
                        code. This allowed me to work on core gameplay mechanics in a controlled environment without
                        having to wait for final assets. The testing scene was crucial for iterating on features and
                        ensuring functionality before integrating them into the full levels. It helped streamline

                    <h6>Overview:</h6>
                    <p>The Person, In the Cabin, In the Woods is a horror puzzle game where you find yourself in a cabin
                        at night. A cryptic computer guides you on your next steps as you must navigate the creepy
                        environment, balancing your sanity, thirst, and sleepiness while avoiding the monster lurking
                        outside. With your vitals low, how can you defeat the monster before it can get to you? What is
                        the computer suggesting? Is there really a way to defeat the beast that lurks in the woods?</p>

                    <h6>University Coursework:</h6>
                    <p>The Person, In the Cabin, In the Woods is a game submitted for a university assignment in my
                        final year, utilizing
                        free 3D models sourced from online platforms like the Unity Asset Store, CGTrader, and Mixamo.
                        However, the cabin itself was designed by myself in Blender to meet the specific requisites of
                        the
                        module for which the submission was created. The cabin features multiple rooms which the player
                        must navigate in order to find specific items to aid in their survival.</p>

                    <h6>Technical Skills:</h6>
                    <p>As this coursework was part of my third and final year, it tested my technical skills in greater
                        depth. The game includes many features implemented around core aspects of the game development
                        cycle, such as 3D modeling, 2D design, particle systems, audio, animation, and coding. This
                        allowed me to demonstrate my proficiency in multiple areas of game development. This module
                        challenged me to integrate these technical skills effectively, resulting in a polished final
                        product.</p>

                    <h6>GitHub:</h6>
                    <p>GitHub was heavily used for code and project management throughout the development process,
                        alongside Kanban boards and MS Sticky Notes for task organization. The version control features
                        of GitHub allowed me to track changes and maintain a clean history of the game's development.
                        Additionally, Kanban boards helped break the project into manageable tasks, serving as weekly
                        goals to ensure I met self-set deadlines. These tools kept me organized and on track during my
                        university studies.</p>

                        you traverse into the woods on the outskirts of the city, a hidden bunker awaits your safety.
                        With shooter drones mercilessly hunting you down, can you reach your destination before the
                        government catches you?</p>

                    <h6>Additional Info:</h6>
                    <h6>Player Movement:</h6>
                    <p>As the lead programmer on this project, I took full responsibility for developing the code such
                        as the movement mechanics, which was the core feature of Rebellion. I designed and implemented
                        the dynamic parkour abilities, ensuring that Eve’s actions were responsive, and intuitive. The
                        system I created enabled smooth transitions based on player input and velocity, resulting in a
                        seamless and immersive experience. Through my work, I laid the foundation for the game’s
                        movement system, making it integral to the gameplay and essential to the overall experience.</p>

                    <h6>Animation:</h6>
                    <p>Eve features a dynamic animation system powered by a complex animation tree, which facilitates
                        seamless transitions between a wide range of movements, such as climbing, vaulting over
                        obstacles, and sliding under low fences. Each action is triggered by player input (e.g.,
                        pressing space to jump, shift to crouch), with Eve's movement influenced by her current velocity
                        (for instance, shifting mid-run triggering a slide).<br>
                        The animation system also adapts to various environments, activating unique animations when
                        interacting with specific objects, like climbing a rope ladder or gradually slowing down when
                        crouched. This depth of animation significantly enhances the immersive gameplay experience, with
                        Eve’s model reacting realistically to changes in speed and momentum, making her movements feel
                        natural and synchronized with the world around her.
